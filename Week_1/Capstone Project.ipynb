The accident data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.5 million accident records in this dataset.\n",

    "With this dataset i have the data enough, so now defining the problem, is to predict the severity of a car accident based on attributes like temperature, wind, humidity, etc...\n",
